# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
### Summary
In this Kickstarter analysis, we looked at trends of different subcategories to see which campaigns were successful in different countries. 
We measured the monetary goal value and the pledged values to determine which campaign was successful or a flop. 
We also looked at which campaigns were still going live and which were canceled.

### Challenge
In this challenge, I analyzed two data sets to see the success rates of the Plays subcategory with the outcomes based on either Goals or Launch date.
#### Outcomes Based on Goals

Looking at the line graph above, we can see that when goals were less than $1000, the rate at which campaigns were successful or canceled was equal at around 40% while failed campaigns dropped. It looked like campaigns were more likely to be successful when goals were between $1000 to $4999 and $40000 and $44999. Campaigns were likely to fail when goals were at around $25000 to $29999, $35000 to $39999, and greater than $50000. Lastly, campaigns were most likely to cancel when goals were either less than $1000 or greater than $50000. From this data we can say that there is no clear indicator at which a campaign would be successful or a flop at a specific goal range. But if a goal is too ambitious or too little to be worth anyones time, the campaign would most likely be canceled. 
#### Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In this graph we analyzed the success rate of theaters in a span of a year. Looking at the graph, it seems that theaters are canceled at a low but consitent rate. The best time a theater should run is from April thru July. The data shows that there was a total 369 in that span of four months. Theaters seems to fail the least at around December but that is also when it is the least successful.
